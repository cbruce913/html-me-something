            <h4>Oceanics</h4>
            <img src="" alt="Oceanics Logo"><!-- insert Ocean logo -->
            <p>The Oceanics are a team that has seen their fair share of high and low tides. Growing up as friends in the city of Dunduei in Oceania, the group ironically never learned to swim until their first Marblelympics invitation and as such is notoriously bad at the water events in which they participate. Going with a dark blue with blue stripes as their colors reflects their Oceanian heritage. Although they have made 5 total appearances and have even managed to place 3rd; after last year's abyssmal performance landing them in last place with no medals and resulting in the coach being fired during the 13th event, this year they have something to prove.</p>
