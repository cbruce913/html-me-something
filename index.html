            <p>The hosts of this year's Marblelympics, Team Galactic, is one of the most regular qualifiers for the Marble Olympics. They hail from the Western Asian city of Galakonur, renowned for its scientific advancement, specifically in astronomy. Their team colors are transparent silver and brown ribbons. This is their 5th appearance at the Marblelympics, though they have yet to take home the coveted Marble League Trophy, topping out at only 5th place.

            <p>Being one of the best new teams their rookie year has granered the Racers a strong legacy to start on. The Raspberry Racers come from the city of Rubow in Central Europe, which is renowned as the raspberry capital of the world, due to the high number of raspberry farms in it's vicinity. The Racers are former competitiors from the Fruit Circuit and carry over a strong rivalry with the Limers. Their colors are shades of magenta with baby pink stripes. This will be their 3rd Marblelympics entry. The Raspberry Racers are our most recent Marble League champions and intend to keep their title this year.</p>

            <p>Another newer team, The Hazers debuted in 2018 with a resounding rookie year performance. While they originate from Eastern Asia, from where specifically is shrouded in mystery. There are rumors they might be from Southern Hunluen considering there is a souvenier shop dedicated to them located there, although there are hints that point to them training on the Mount Huaze mountain range as well. They have chosen smokey grey and white as their colors. This is also their 3rd apperance in the Marble League and they are hoping they can top their previous years record of a 3rd place finish.</p>

            <p>The Green Ducks are one of the more recent teams to qualify for Marble League, with their first appearance being last year. They come from a small British Isle named Bermenghank by way of Dionlin. To pay homage to the team being formed through an unlikely meeting on a duck farm, the Green Ducks opted for a name and colors that signify home. Their chose colors are an army green with brown & black swirls. Though this is their 2nd Marble League participation, they have already made a name for themselves by achieveing 2nd last year. They will definitely be a team to watch out for this year.</p>

            <p>The Savage Speeders are one of the oldest and most decorated teams in Marble League. They are collectively from Western Europe, specifically:Speedy and Rapidly from Accellaise on the southern coast, Velocity from Pace on the same coastline to the east, and Swiftly from the capital city of Vellis, each of which is respectively known for its cultural, artistic, and economic significance. A combination of red with yellow and white are the agreed upon colors. The Savage Speeders have participated in every Marble League to date, in fact, they were the winners of the very 1st Marble League. Will they be able to reclaim their throne this year?</p>

While not previously acquainted; the team fully hails from the North African city of Felynia, located between two rivers, known for its prestige in film and entertainment with winding sand dunes to the east, nicknamed the <a href="https://jellesmarbleruns.fandom.com/wiki/Crazy_Cat%27s_Eyes#History">"Cat's Dunes"</a>. Opting to go for a classic Transparent look, each member of the team sports a specific color that has a connection for them. This year will be the 3rd time the Crazy Cat's Eyes will have made it to the Marble League as competitors and while they have yet to place higher than 10th, they give their all every year.</p><aside>The Cat's Dunes are named after the team's namesake, <a href="https://jellesmarbleruns.fandom.com/wiki/Crazy_Cat%27s_Eyes#History">Crazy Cat's Eye</a> who is a copetitor in the Sand Marble Rally.</aside>

            <p>The Oceanics are a team that has seen their fair share of high and low tides. Growing up as friends in the city of Dunduei in Oceania, the group ironically never learned to swim until their first Marblelympics invitation and as such is notoriously bad at the water events in which they participate. Going with a dark blue with blue stripes as their colors reflects their Oceanian heritage. Although they have made 5 total appearances and have even managed to place 3rd; after last year's abyssmal performance landing them in last place with no medals and resulting in the coach being fired during the 13th event, this year they have something to prove.</p>
