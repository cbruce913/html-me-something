            <h4>Team Galactic</h4>

Their team colors are transparent silver and white. This is their 5th appearence at the Marblelympics and though they have yet to take home the coveted Marble League Trophy; if they can manage it this year, the victory will be sweetened by the knowledge it was done at home.</p>

            <h4>Raspberry Racers</h4>
            <p>The Raspberry Racers come from the city of Rubow in Central Europe, which is renowned as the raspberry capital of the world, due to it's high number of raspberry farms in it's vicinity. The Racers are former competitiors from the Fruit Circuit and carry over a strong rivalry with the Limers. Their colors are shades of magenta with baby pink stripes. This will be their 3rd Marblelympics entry. The Raspberry Racers are our most recent Marble League champions and intend to keep their title this year.</p>

            <h4>Hazers</h4>
            <p>The Hazers originate from Eastern Asia, although from where specifically is shrouded in mystery. There are rumors they might be from Southern Hunluen considering there is a souvenier shop dedicated to them located there although there are hints that point to them training on the Mount Huaze mountain range. They have chosen smokey gray and white as their colors. This is also their 3rd apperance in the Marble League and they are hoping they can top their previous years record of a 3rd place finish.</p>

            <h4>Green Ducks</h4>
            <p>The Green Ducks are one of the newer teams to qualify for Marble League, with their first appearence being last year. They come from a small British Isle named Bermenghank by way of Dionlin. To pay homage to the team being formed through an unlikely meeting on a duck farm, the Green Ducks opted for a name and colors that signify home. Their chose colors are an army green with brown & black swirls. Though this is their 2nd Marble League participation, they have already made a name for themselves by achieveing 2nd last year. They will definitely be a team to watch out for this year.</p>

            <img src="" alt="Savage Speeders Logo"><!-- insert Sav Spd logo -->
            <h4>Savage Speeders</h4>
            <p>The Savage Speeders are one of the most veteran and decorated teams in Marble League. They are collectively from Western Europe, specifically:Accellaise on the southern coast, Pace on the same coastline to the east, and the capital city of Vellis, each of which is individually known for its cultural, artistic, and economic significance. A combination of red with yellow and white are the agreed upon colors. The Savage Speeders have participated in every Marble League to date, in fact, they were the winners of the very 1st Marble League. Will they be able to reclaim their throne this year?</p>

            <img src="" alt="Crazy Cat's Eyes Logo"><!-- insert Crzy Cat Eyes logo -->
            <h4>Crazy Cat's Eyes</h4>
            <p>The team best known for being the models for the <a href="">Marble League Logo</a>, the Crazy Cat's Eyes are well known throughout the professional marble world. While not previously acquainted; the team fully hails from the North African city of Felynia, located between two rivers, known for its prestige in film and entertainment with winding sand dunes to the east, nicknamed the "Cat's Dunes". Opting to go for a classic Transparent look, each member of the team sports a specific color that has a connection for them. This year will be the 3rd time CCE has made it to the Marble League as competitors and while they have yet to place higher than 10th, they give their all every year.</p>

            <img src="" alt="Oceanics Logo"><!-- insert Ocean logo -->
            <h4>Oceanics</h4>
            <p>The Oceanics are a team that has seen their fair share of high and low tides. Growing up as friends in the city of Dunduei in Oceania, the group ironically never learned to swim until their first Marblelympics invitation and as such is notoriously bad at the water events in which they participate. Going with a dark blue with blue stripes as their colors reflects their Oceanian heritage. Although they have made 5 total appearences and have even managed to place 3rd; after last year's abyssmal performance landing them in last place with no medals and resulting in the coach being fired during the 13th event, this year they have something to prove.</p>

            <img src="" alt="Balls of Chaos Logo"><!-- insert Bll o Chs logo -->
            <h4>Balls of Chaos</h4>
            <p>The Balls of Chaos are one of the oldest teams in marble sport history, dating back to the start of the millennium. They come from the city of Hunluen, the most populated city in East Asia and the world. The Balls of Chaos, similar to the Cat's Eyes, have opted for a Transparent color but have decided to all have a mix of red, blue, and yellow. This will be the Balls of Chaos' 4th appearence and they will be hoping for a podium position this time around in order to break their standing record of 5th.</p>
